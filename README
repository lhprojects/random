HOW TO USE

METHOD 1
Add source files to your project except those with a prefix `test_'.
METHOD 2
Use it as library.
(This is not a big project, you can use it the way you like.)

HOW TO CONFIGURE

Define the global macro `scalar_t' and `RANDOM_BASIC_SCALAR_FUNCTION', If they not defined, `double' will be used for `scalar_t' and <cmath> for RANDOM_BASIC_SCALAR_FUNCTION.
`random.sln' is an example for `double', and `qdrandom.sln' is an example for `qd_real'.
